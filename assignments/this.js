/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Global Binding is "this" shown as the whole object where 'this' can be found
* 2. Implicit Binding is "this" binded to a specific key inside of an object
* 3. In  New Binding "this" is being used in constructor functions which are called by using the keyword new
    What that means is "this" is found in the constructor function but used in multiple objects created with the keyword new.
* 4. Explicit Binding 
.call .apply .bind takes the properties from one object and applies it to the object using .call .apply or.bind
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
